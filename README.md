During the 2025 Summer TFL Train Strikes, the underground lines were inconsistent and delayed.

I built a simple webpage (https://jtc469.github.io/Transport/) to grab TFL and weather data in London.

I then built an IOS automation (Apple Shortcuts) to grab data from the webpage, and send me a daily notification at 7am.
I used this while working in London over summer so I knew if I needed to wear a jacket, and if the train lines are running that day following the strikes.
